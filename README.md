## Description

My motivation is to create a README generator that utilizes Node to prompt the user for answers to autofill a README template.

I built this project for users to easily create a README by answering a series of questions. README's can be a chore for some, so this streamlines the process and provides a README that's filled in by the user's answers.

This solves the issue of writing a README. As stated before, many find writing a README to be a chore. Rather than having to seach for a good template, this just takes the user's input and creates a README with all the neccessary features..

I learned how to utilize Node, arrow functions, template literals, and how to generate files.

## Installation

Download or fork this package. From there, open the integrated terminal (this is for VSCode) and run the following: 1. `npm init`, 2. `npm i`, 3. `npm -i inquirer@8.2.4`.

## Usage

In the integrated table, run `node index` and answer the prompts. NOTE: If you don't have an answer for a prompt, enter N/A or none, and this can can be editted or deleted by the user in the README md document. After answering the prompts, the README.md will be generated in /Develop..
